scrapes news headlines/urls,craigslist job posts, and exports RCP news into CSV file - Then sends them all (2 text files and 1 excel spreadsheet) as an email attachment
*Please note even slight changes to website code will break the scrape if it is expecting objects that have been removed/re-named, but they are usually pretty easy to fix. It looks like the RCP scrape may already be broken but the clistScraper still works wonders (love you craiglists for never changing) and the rest can be used as a template (Works on multiple versions but I recently confirmed still works on Python 3.7, although you will need dependencies like beautifulsoup installed
